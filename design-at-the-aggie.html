				Improving the work-life balance of The Aggie’s graphic designers through a reevaluated workflow.

			<div class="proposal">
				<p>
					The California Aggie is a weekly newspaper run entirely by UC Davis students for campus students, staff, and the Davis community. Around 4,000 copies are distributed every Thursday to over 40 locations in Davis, along with articles posted daily at <a href="theaggie.org" target="_blank"> theaggie.org </a>. I started in 2016 as a layout artist and became design director the following year. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As design director, I worked closely with the layout director and editors to finalize layouts for print, and coordinating production of graphics, advertisements, and layouts.

			<p>
				While I was a layout artist, I sometimes helped out the design director with last-minute graphic assignments. That’s when I saw how stressed and unhappy both the design director and graphic designers were with their work. Layout artists only needed to come in and work on Mondays and Tuesdays to get their page layouts built and edited, but graphic designers were constantly on-call throughout the week because they’d never know when their next assignment would arrive. It was unpredictable, inconsistent, and caused a third of new hires to quit every quarter.

					The first task was to redesign the workflow

				<span>
					before the school year started. I took a look at the overall production process and tools (mostly Google Drive) used between different teams and found several problems:

			</p>
			<p>
				<span style="font-weight: 600">
					Problems	
				</span>
				<span>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Inconsistent spreadsheets for photo and graphics assignments made it harder on editors inputting assignments weekly.
						</li>
						<li>
							No communication for when assignments were in made it harder on the design director to notice and give graphic designers enough time to complete their assignments.
						</li>
						<li>
							Inconsistent design archive system made it harder for the Media team to search for specific graphics to use for the website and on social media.
						</li>
					</ol>

			<p>
				Mondays became the final deadline for editors to input photo and graphic assignments, and frequent communication between all teams about any changes or late assignments helped tremendously in keeping things running smoothly. The reorganized graphics folder also helped the Media team find everything they needed in a single folder.

				<span style="font-weight: 600">

				</span>
				<span>
					Many of the designers said that they had joined The Aggie to improve their graphic design skills and learn from their coworkers. With the old assignment system, designers could do their job entirely remotely without hearing from anyone else. To fix this, I held remote meetings at the same time assignments were distributed to give designers a chance to critique each other's’ work, and get feedback on what went well and what could be stronger.

				Final Thoughts
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="text_body">
			<p>
				In the end, all of our new and returning graphic designers stayed, averaging 7 students a quarter. Next steps would be to improve how graphic designers get feedback. The remote meetings were a good way to share what each designer had worked on, but the actual critique could be more helpful and less forced. 
			</p>
			<p style="color: #9B9B9B;">
				On another note: The Aggie also needs to create a separate Google Drive for its staff and organization. While I was there, The Aggie had its archives scattered across multiple student Google Drives. This caused many problems with end-of-the-year transitions, as incoming staff only had folders to archives dating back to whenever they first started working at The Aggie. This loss of information and knowledge sets new managing staff back by a few weeks at the beginning of the school year as they try to figure out how to run the newspaper. Before I graduated, I started a handbook for the design team, detailing The Aggie’s design history, the evolution of layout styles, and my thoughts about my experience, in hopes that future design teams have something to look back on and build upon.
