					The City of Davis was seeking proposals to redesign G Street Plaza, an overlooked downtown public space that was a popular urination and gathering site for drunk college students and homeless folks. Its vision was to re-imagine the space as a “dynamic, engaging gathering area”. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I worked with Zoe Marin and John Bailey to propose a solution for Davis's G Street Plaza. My responsibilities over 8 weeks were user research, rapid prototyping and project management.

				Davis’s G Street Plaza is quiet… too quiet. Unlike other plazas downtown, it had no sense of community and frequent unwanted behavior. The City of Davis saw that it still had some potential, and listed a few goals and considerations as part of its redesign:

					Meet Aiden, the lonely improv musician

			<p>
				We went downtown to observe differences between other plazas (E Street Plaza & Central Park) and to interview strangers on downtown's public spaces. That's where we met Aiden, a Davis native in his 30's that uses music to find a community where he belongs. Out of the 16 people we interviewed, he stood out to us the most because, even though he preferred to avoid people, he'd go out of his way to find someone downtown to jam with.

					And this is about more than just Aiden. <a href="https://cnprc.ucdavis.edu/immune-responses-to-loneliness-similar-in-monkeys-and-people/" target="_blank">A 2015 study by UC Davis's primate research center</a> suggested loneliness to be a significant cause of stress, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and early death. It peaks in adolescents and young adults, and again in the elderly. And you don't have to be alone to feel lonely. It's the quality of relationships and not the time spent in them that is more important.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Davis, where the median age is 26 and getting younger, it might be hard for older adults like Aiden to build those quality relationships. We decided to tackle this problem and focus on creating an environment for social interaction, investing in relationships and changing people’s perceptions on their social lives.

					We used several different sensemaking tools (empathy map, 2x2, generic parts diagram) to approach our interviews from different viewpoints and understand our user needs. The major findings we uncovered were that

				<span style="font-weight: 700;">
					safety and trust is a major concern

				<span>
					downtown and that

				<span style="font-weight: 700;">
					public art requires a specific time and place.

				Our initial concepts — an open mic stage, a musical waterfall and piano stairs — explored our first problem statement, how might we make Aiden feel like a star when he’s Downtown, thinking that Aiden just needed an official gathering spot to play music in public.

				We gravitated towards the piano stairs concept and tested several iterations with our classmates and Downtown. But as we tested we found that it wasn’t so much as making people feel like the center of attention — people disliked putting themselves out there — but that folks were more likely to approach our box drum prototype with friends and music playing in the background than alone.

				Iteration #1 (Piano stairs + mini drums): Our classmates wanted to see something original and felt intimidated playing by themselves. Iteration #2 (Bucket drums): We brought this prototype to G Street Plaza and E Street Plaza and it failed. People thought it was trash and went out of their way to avoid it.

				Iteration #3 (Box drums + xylophone): John made a xylophone out of wrenches and a foam tube and Zoe laser cut a quick cardboard drum structure. We tested this at Central Park's weekly farmers market, and some mentioned that it would be great if more people could play along on either sides of the structure.

				FINAL PRODUCT

			<div class="tagline">
				<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
					How might we create an interactive environment that fosters quality relationships and a sense of belonging?

				Our final concept is the Urban Soundscape, an outdoor musical space where anyone can hang out or jam with. It’s composed of  steel drums and a limestone xylophone that withstands Davis's sunny weather, with consideration to ADA requirements for wheelchair accessibility and clearance. To take this further, we'd need to create more refined digital mockups and continue testing whether a larger urban sound installation would fulfill a downtown visitor's need for belonging in the community.

				I did some research into existing outdoor percussion instruments and found Sonic Architecture, an artist/musician duo that used sculptural instruments as public art at parks and museums. This helped inform possible materials and forms for our final proposal.

				Troubleshooting chart based on people’s feedback on our last prototype— either we probably aren’t solving something meaningful and need to go back and make additional inferences, or we’re right on track and need to check our assumptions and create more refined prototypes.
			</div>
			<p>
				Over 8 weeks I learned how to interview strangers and how to embrace ambiguity even when nothing seemed “right”. I also learned the importance of building trust in your team — there were problems with miscommunication and hurt feelings that I think translated into our final pitch to the City of Davis. If I were to do things differently, I would go back and take a look at existing downtown communities and events to see how they create a sense of belonging in a public space.
