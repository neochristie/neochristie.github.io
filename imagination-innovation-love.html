				<p>
					KFF is a multi-cultural festival for children of all ages. As one of the largest events for kids in the Bay Area, its mission is “to foster a more peaceful community through cultural awareness and appreciation to achieve greater cultural understanding, ethnic diversity and international cognizance.”
				</p>
				<p>
					My mentor and friend <a href="https://www.behance.net/thejohnnychang" target="_blank">Johnny</a> and I were asked to make KFF’s visual identity more relatable and engaging to children from all backgrounds in the Bay Area.

				A couple of parents founded KFF as a way to celebrate happiness carried throughout one’s life. Being mostly engineers and doctors by profession, they put together a visual identity that was convincing enough to parents of younger children in elementary school, but looked too childish to preteens and teenagers. Most of the festival volunteers and leadership were also older first generation parents looking to pass the torch and get younger generations involved.
			</p>
			<p>
				Seeing the importance of good design to younger generations and facing competition from other local Bay Area kids festivals, KFF wanted to increase their competitiveness for sponsorships and bring in more youth through rebranding their identity.

					We started by asking the client about KFF’s vision and values, as well as things to avoid (like political colors), in an effort to be sensitive to other cultures and points of view. Two words kept coming up: 
				</span>
				<span style="font-weight: 700;">
					collaborative and multicultural.

				<span style="font-weight: 700;">
					brainstorms 
				</span>
				<span>
					to get associations and thoughts down. The three main directions that came out of our exploration and research were: Games We Play, The Magic Touch, and Seeing is Believing.

			<p>
				KFF’s board members were immediately drawn to the colors of concept 2a, but liked that the characters from concept 3a might act as mascots for the different festival “villages” (e.g. science & tech village, children’s games village). After some discussion, they chose concept 1b because it reminded them of building blocks and play, and wanted to include the characters from concept 3a.

			<p>
				With the visual direction mostly clear, we played with how the logo and characters would live within KFF and settled with a more minimal design that wouldn’t get lost in the noise and colors of the festival. We applied this across apparel, tote bags, signage and program booklets.

				KFF needed to update its visual identity as one of the largest festivals for kids in the Bay Area. Our redesign improved KFF’s professionalism and sponsorships, and was well received by KFF’s leadership, volunteers and festivalgoers. Because of the scale of KFF’s event, the new identity will take a few years to roll out. In the meantime, updating KFF’s website and social media would work best to reach its younger audience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through working with Johnny, I learned how to present clearly and walk clients through concepts. Sometimes you need to step back and choose a more straightforward answer than one that only gets more and more convoluted. What still needs work is applying the redesign to where people first encounter KFF (eg. website, social media, flyers, newsletters), and establishing a media team to increase community engagement.
