					<a href="https://lyf.tacl.org/">LYF</a> is a 501(c)(3) non-profit with a mission to guide Taiwanese-American youth toward a deeper understanding of identity and culture, and to nurture curious, open minds to actively engage in the community. LYF's Creative Team brings the program directors' visions to life each year by incorporating the theme in camp marketing and programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					I worked with <a href="https://www.behance.net/thejohnnychang">Johnny</a>, our Creative Director, and the rest of Creative Team (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirbywang/">Shirby</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shereen.lee.96?ref=br_rs">Shereen</a>, <a href="https://jonathanchen.design">Jon</a>) to create 2017’s visual theme. Our solution was to illustrate different ways of practicing self-compassion.​​​​​​​

				Creative Team’s biggest challenge every year is turning an abstract concept into a memorable experience for campers, parents and staff. Compared to previous years, 2017’s theme of self-compassion was more introspective, so we each had a different take on what self-compassion looked like to us and how we might practice it outwardly.

				Initial sketches were too focused on the perception of being trapped or feeling alone, and the act of reaching out for help.

				Later sketches focused on the character practicing self-compassion with a reflective landscape within its outline. My final digital piece pictures a meditating figure with the sky inside. Below are a few other illustrations by the Creative Team:

				“Our nebulous character is on an inward journey that challenges his self-compassion. His outward outline shows him doing activities that put self- compassion into practice (for example, reflecting on oneself, searching, climbing, meditating, treating oneself nicely, etc). Within his outline is the inner landscape he must travel through, and is an analogy for some of the challenges he faces in life that need a bit of self-compassion and empathy. These challenges may include understanding who he is, his identity amongst his peers, communicating with his family, and how to be a leader in a troubling world.” (Johnny Chang, 2017 Creative Director)

				2017 was my third year as a staff member and designer for LYF, and my first year where the visual theme was so closely integrated with the camp programming. Our illustrations echoed what was taught at camp, with campers practicing self-love and meditation, and this made the message even stronger. 2018 saw 40% of 2017 campers pre-registering for 2018, the highest its been compared to previous years, and camper retention (~50%) consistent with 2017.

				I learned that the role of the designer can be so much more than a simple transaction. To create a lasting impact, designers should not only start an ongoing conversation with program directors (or the client) to understand their intentions, but also suggest ways to strengthen the message outside of visuals. Send them inspiration, short stories, or podcasts to push their vision into a clear message. Then work on how it’s executed, how workshops and camp activities fit in with this message and where visuals can be placed to take home the message.
